# FastAPI Development Guide

## Introduction
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Key Features
- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
- **Fast to code**: Increase development speed by about 200% to 300%
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support with completion everywhere
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation

## Installation
```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn[standard]
```

## Basic Example
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

## Best Practices
1. Use type hints for all parameters
2. Implement proper error handling with HTTPException
3. Add comprehensive documentation with docstrings
4. Use dependency injection for shared functionality
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring
